Feature: Editing a Notebook
As a researcher I should be able to edit the content of my notebook so that I can program from within beaker.

  Background:
    Given I am viewing beaker
    Then I see the the user dashboard
    And I create a notebook

  Scenario: Setting a headline
    When I set the headline to "Another brick in the Wall"
    Then I should see the headline "Another brick in the Wall"
